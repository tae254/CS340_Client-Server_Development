# CS340_Client-Server_Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  1. Make sure everything is a semantic as possible
  2. Make sur to write small concise bits of code.
  3. Comment out code so that you and other devs know exactly what the patch of code is for and what it does. 
  4. Don't repeat code and get rid of any dead code
  5. Be consistent in how you write code and make sure to use same techniques throughout the program. 
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  As a computer scientist you approach eveyrthing as a problme that you are trying to solve. Considering the Grazioso Salvare requirments I took the time 
  to make sure that I understand the problem that is trying to be solved (their requirments) and make sure that I understand how to implement the solution. 
  There were times throughout this course that I had to search outside of SNHU to find solutions to the problem. What I have learned is that the answer 
  might not be described in the way I can understand in the textbooks, so doing my own research on a solution helps a lot. 
  
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  As i said in the previous question, computer scientist solve problems. In the specific case of this course we solved a problem for Grazioso Salvare. The 
  problem wass they needed to have a way to identify dog breeds that were in the Austin Animal Shelter database that could be useful in rescue missions.
  Computer Science matters because without the knowledge to solve these problems in a technology based world we as people would be so far behind where we
  are now.
